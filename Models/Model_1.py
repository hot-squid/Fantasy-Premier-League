# Model_1

# This model uses the FD_index to choose the best players. The FD_index is a 
# simple calculation of current form/upcoming fixture difficulty. The fixture
# difficulty can be planned for up to 5 weeks. The model will choose the players
# that have the highest form per lowest fixture difficulty, and optimally select
# a team given the constraints of budget, position and team limit. 

# Define constants

BUDGET = 1000 # Choose your budget (1000 = Â£100m)
WEEKS = 1 # Choose how many weeks you want to prepare for between 1 and 5
GK = 2 # Goalkeepers required (Choose between 0 and 2)
DEF = 5 # Defenders required (Choose between 0 and 5)
MID = 5 # Midfielders required (Choose between 0 and 5)
FWD = 3 #  Forwards required (Choose between 0 and 3)
